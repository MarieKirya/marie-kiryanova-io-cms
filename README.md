Marie Kiryanova Portfolio CMS
======

Introduction
-------

This holds Composer and Drupal config for my CMS. There's not much special to it, but it may serve as a good example as to putting together a vendor-less Drupal repo.

Installation
--------

There's very little bells and whistles so the installation is just like any basic Drupal 8 site.

1. Run `composer install`
1. Point webserver to /web and configure environment variables to the correct database.
1. Run minimal site install profile
1. Import configuration.
